To run the AES implementation program, follow these steps:

Install the required library: PyCryptodome. You can install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pycryptodome
Copy the AES implementation code into a Python file with a .py extension. For example, you can create a file called aes_example.py and paste the code there.

Save the file and navigate to the directory where the file is located using the terminal or command prompt.

Run the Python file by executing the following command:

python aes_example.py
The program will output the plaintext, ciphertext, and decrypted plaintext.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and it is added to your system's PATH variable. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install libraries and execute Python scripts.

That's it! You have successfully run the AES implementation program.
